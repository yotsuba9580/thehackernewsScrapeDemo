# Web Scraper for The Hacker News

This project provides a Python-based web scraper to extract articles from The Hacker News website.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with **Python 3.8**.
2. Create and activate a new Conda environment.
3. Install required dependencies using `conda` or `pip`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yotsuba9580/thehackernewsScrapeDemo.git
    cd thehackernewsScrapeDemo
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up a proxy if required (e.g., via Clash or any proxy service).

## Usage

1. **Run the Scraper**:
    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```

2. **Output**:
    - Articles will be saved to `articles.csv` in the current directory.
    - The scraper will also save the last processed date to `last_processed_date.txt` for resuming scraping later.

3. **Resuming Scraping**:
    - The scraper automatically resumes from the last processed date if `last_processed_date.txt` exists. To restart from the beginning, delete this file.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Pages**:
    - Uses `requests` to fetch HTML content from The Hacker News, with retries and delay to avoid rate limits.

2. **Parsing HTML**:
    - Extracts article titles, URLs, and dates using `lxml` and XPath expressions.
  
## Example Output

Example of a row in `articles.csv`:

| Title                                | Date       | URL                                                         |
